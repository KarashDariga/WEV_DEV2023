        <p>The <em>Cat</em> is awesome because <strong>Cats can be left by themselves for a while. You can take a short vacation and leave them at home. All they need is enough food and water to make it through. They donâ€™t get separation anxiety and tear up your entire house like dogs do.</strong>.</p>
