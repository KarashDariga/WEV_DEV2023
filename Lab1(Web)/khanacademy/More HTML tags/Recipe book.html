        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Do something.
Knowing how to cook pasta properly is the foundation for many a great meal. Simply follow a few basic rules: use a big pot with lots of water, more salt than you think you need, and watch the clock. Below Iâ€™ll share my easy technique for cooking pasta perfectly whether to serve in warm dishes or a salad.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>
            According to legendary Italian cookbook author Marcella Hazan, the spaghetti or pasta itself should be the final thing you cook when making a pasta dinner. Everything else, sauce, etc., should be ready to go. That way, the spaghetti can be drained, tossed with sauce for proper sauce-noodle adhesion and served pronto!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add the dried pasta. Stir until the water returns to a boil. Set a timer for one minute less than the package instructions recommend. Test for doneness at this point. If you like your pasta very firm (al dente) or are going to be simmering for a while in sauce, check and remove even sooner.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>When ready to use, add to warm sauce, toss and finish cooking or chill for later use.
